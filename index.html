    <h3>Team Workflow Verification</h3>
    <ul type="square">
        <li>Registered teams can track <b> developmental progress </b> and <b> enrich operational structure </b> </li>
	<li>By tokenizing utility factors used to indicate success and MVP construction goals, managing tasks from various platforms to deduce work output becomes easy as pie. </li>
	<li>Utilizing smart contract technology means that there is no worry about visibility when sharing with outside entities for work varification; receipts for the verfiication process allow for there to be no need to spread actual work product to outside entities during development.</li>
 <li>Penultimately, 111 uses it workflow verification to facilitate evaaluation events, such as live demonstrations and investor piteches. Evaluations allow for both teams and reviewers to determine startup viability and MVP scores as well as create networking events that can be used to initiate and promote pre-ordering.</li>

    <h3>Market Due Diligence</h3>
    <ul type="square">
        <li>111 provides due-diligence processes for reviewing and managing market interfacing, as well as internal and external activites useful to <b> securitization </b> and </b> collateralization.</li>
	<li>The platform procedurally reviews the activity and validity of capital resources, such as from and by angel and venture investors, through methods such as checks for pertinent federal and state registrations</li>
	<li>The peer-to-peer (P2P) activity and interactivity of network participants (both in work teams and in investors) allows for implicit identification and validation of various claims, assets, and security features (i.e., analogous to implicit password and associated identifications).</li>
	<li>Verify that a digital asset or cryptotoken is a security or utility: Our smart contracts are tuned for federal and state laws related to security compliance. This allows users to identify international implementability, deployability, and operability without large labor and paperwork overheads.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Pre-Order Launches</h3>
    <ul type="square">
        <li>Use pre-orders to help define market value for an MVP: As startups and other incubated teams develop their MVPs, revenue projections are liable to be difficult to generate for novel  products in niche or under-explored markets; creating a list of pre-orders helps startups ascertain a suitable return-on-investment (ROI) to help establish viable funding and financing models for initial and continual captial acquisition.</li>
	<li>Pre-orders are committed to a blockchain with 111's smart contracts after escalating earlier registration and analogues of letters of interest/intent into fuller and more fiscally-responsive letters of support; LoSs are easier to gauge in terms of reveue generations and ROI profitability as there are sufficient financial data present to make a reasonable, but unsecuritized, ROI calculation.</li>
	<li>No more wildly inaccurate pre-order timelines: Pre-order token are later claimed and exchanged for order tokens to then later confirm actual payments upon a blockchain-based payment system and provide more secure receipts for transactions.Pre-order customers can view team progress by having access to a verison of the workflow verification data.</li>
